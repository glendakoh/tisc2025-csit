# TISC CSIT 2025

Really happy to have completed Level 8 of TISC 2025! ðŸŽ‰
This time, I took the reverse engineering route and even had my first experience with memory exploits!
Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have time to write the full writeups during the competition, so Iâ€™m only doing them now, well after it ended.
As such, this is just a brief summary of a few challenges where I managed to keep some screenshots.
Iâ€™ll work on writing more complete and structured writeups in future competitions!
