# TISC CSIT 2025

Really happy to complete level 8 of TISC 2025! Took the reverse engineering route this time and had my first memory exploits!
Unfortunately, I did not have time to complete the writeups during the competition and am only doing it much after the competition ended. As such, this is a very brief writeup of some challenges where I kept some screenshots.
Definitely need to work on better writeups in the future!
