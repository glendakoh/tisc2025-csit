# TISC CSIT Challenge 1 — Target Reference Point 🛰️ GEOINT (OSINT)

**Category:** GEOINT / OSINT  
**Challenge:** Identify the lake in the middle of the provided world map image.

## Summary

Given a world map with a lake marked in the center, the goal was to identify the lake's name. Many people rotated the image and used reverse image search; I found it by visually scanning and zooming — luck played a part!
